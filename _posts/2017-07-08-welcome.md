Hey there friend! Welcome to my site. My name is Nafeu and you can learn more about who I am [here](/about). I created this website for the purpose of sharing lessons that I have learned and fostering discussions about topics like growth-mindset, productivity, full-stack web development, music production, midi-controllerism, mental health, etc.

Do I have a plan? Not entirely. My last experience with blogging was in 2005 and it was on the most professional blogging platform ever created called **MSN Spaces** (just kidding it wasn't professional, and its been decomissioned for years, you can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Spaces)).

I was in fifth grade at the time and the content of my blog consisted mostly of novice artwork I had made in Photoshop and posts about a stuffed animal I had that had posable joints.

Although I'll never be able to top the content quality of that blog, I hope you find something on this site that is of interest or of help. If you have an questions feel free to shoot me an email at [nafeu.nasir@gmail.com](mailto:nafeu.nasir@gmail.com?subject=greetings).

Cheers!
