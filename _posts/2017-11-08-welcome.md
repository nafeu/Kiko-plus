Hey there friend! Welcome to my site. My name is Nafeu and you can learn more about who I am [here](/about). I created this website for the purpose of sharing lessons that I have learned and fostering discussions about topics like growth-mindset, productivity, full-stack web development, music production, midi-controllerism, mental health, etc.

My last experience with blogging was in 2005 and it was on a fancy blogging platform known as **[MSN Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Spaces)**. I was in fifth grade at the time and the content of my blog consisted mostly of novice photoshop artwork and posts about one of my stuffed animals who had posable joints.

Although I'll never be able to top the content of that blog, I hope you find something here that is of help or interest. If you have an questions feel free to shoot me an email at [nafeu.nasir@gmail.com](mailto:nafeu.nasir@gmail.com?subject=Greetings).

Cheers!
