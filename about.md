I am a young innovator with a versatile set of skills in full-stack application development, UI/UX design and music production. I am interested in natural language processing, data visualization, machine learning, API economy and open-source technologies.

I like to geek out about spoken language syntax analysis, play first-person shooters and mess around with electronic music under the artist name [Phrakture](http://music.phrakture.com). Follow me on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/nafeu) to see what I've been digging in to lately and feel free to recommend a good book while you are at it!
