I am a young innovator with a versatile set of skills in development, graphic design, soundtrack production and public speaking. I am currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Toronto. I am interested in the fields of natural language processing, data visualization, artificial intelligence and modern user experience design. I look forward to creating innovative and applicable mobile/web solutions, working with IoT devices, writing algorithms for spoken language syntax analysis and leaving my impact in the software industry.
