I am a young innovator with a versatile set of skills in full-stack application development, UI/UX design, music production and digital content creation. I am passionate about software craftsmanship, edutech, data visualization, API economy, and open-source technologies.

Here are some fast facts:
  - I like to play competitive first-person shooters like CS:GO and Overwatch and I practically grew up on Doom and Unreal Tournament 99 (feel free to add me on Steam: [PhraktureMusic](https://steamcommunity.com/id/f1r3freak))
  - I've been making progressive breaks, liquid drum'n'bass and IDM using Cubase under the artist name [Phrakture](http://music.phrakture.com) since 2006 and have recently begun making more indie electronic music under the artist name [Nafeu](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5NhwrCkzOykT6SdxGzwEtL?si=zgwxIaxsS2iIFZZ8GYvuuQ)
  - I make youtube videos for performances and tutorials [here](https://youtube.com/phrakture) and silly gameplay highlights [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCibPYDqdi5hMJbGBMoQ7Z0w/videos)
